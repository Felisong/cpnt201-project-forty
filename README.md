1. Open Terminal or Git Bash:

On Windows, you can use Git Bash or Command Prompt. On macOS or Linux, use the Terminal application.

Use the cd command to change to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example:

```

2. Get the Repository URL:

Go to the repository page on GitHub, Bitbucket, or any other Git hosting service.

Look for a button labeled Code (on GitHub) or Clone (on Bitbucket). Copy the URL provided (either HTTPS or SSH format).
Run the Clone Command:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

3. Change into the Cloned Directory:

After cloning, navigate into the new directory that was created:
